@Stake v3
=======

@Stake is a game that fosters democracy, empathy, and creative problem solving for civic issues. Players take on a variety of roles and pitch ideas under a time pressure, competing to produce the best idea in the eyes of the table's “Decider.” 

This is a mobile (iOS & Android) version of the [tabletop game](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/participation-and-engagement/atstake/) designed by the [Engagement Lab](http://elab.emerson.edu/) at Emerson College.
